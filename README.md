Final Project for CS102: Earl Kwofie, Ryan Cui

//In Progress

This project is intended to be a command line adventure game about a persons regular drive to work in the morning.  
To convey this idea the primary elements we hope to use are:  
  
1. The generated grid maps - which give a random placement for the player and the player goal within any size city grid map
2. Scenarios - obstacles generated the map that either advance or hinder the player from getting to the goal
  
This primary mechanics that we hoping to use to convey this are

1. Player Movement - non diagonal, due to the limitations of the grid
2. Player Stats - player time is tracked to encorage the player to get to the goal in less steps

You start from the upper left corner of the screen.

And try to reach the player goal, or your work location without hitting any of the green "cars".

Which result in a car accident and end the game.
